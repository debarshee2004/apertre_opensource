## Background:

Google Gemini is a family of artificial intelligence models developed by Google DeepMind, serving as the successor to PaLM 21. It was announced on December 6, 2023, and is designed to be multimodal, meaning it can process and combine different types of data, such as text, images, audio, video, and code2. Gemini was built from the ground up to be versatile, scalable, and efficient, enabling a wide range of applications and use cases for AI3.
Gemini is the successor of PaLM 2, the previous AI architecture that powered many of Google’s AI services, such as the Bard chatbot and Duet AI in Workspace apps like Google Docs. Gemini was first announced in December 2023, and the first version of Gemini, called Gemini Ultra, was released in early 2024. Gemini Ultra is the largest and most capable model in the Gemini family, with over 1.5 trillion parameters and the ability to outperform human experts on various multimodal tasks, such as MMLU, DROP, HellaSwag, MMMU, and more12.

## Performance:

Gemini Ultra surpasses the state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks that test the knowledge and problem-solving abilities of AI models. For example, Gemini Ultra scores 90% on MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding), a benchmark that consists of questions in 57 subjects, including STEM, humanities, and others1. Gemini Ultra also scores 74.4% on HumanEval, a benchmark that requires Python code generation1. Moreover, Gemini Ultra demonstrates superior performance on multimodal benchmarks that involve reasoning across text and images, such as MMMU (Multi-discipline college-level reasoning problems), VQAv2 (Natural image understanding), TextVQA (OCR on natural images), and more1.
Gemini is a high-performance blockchain that aims to solve problems of scalability and transaction throughput that plague other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gemini uses a novel approach called active multi-party computation (MPC) combined with sharding to achieve throughputs that surpass centralized systems. 
MPC refers to cryptographic protocols where multiple parties can perform a computation on private inputs without revealing those inputs to each other or any external observers. In Gemini's MPC protocol, a transaction is split into cryptographic shares that are distributed across multiple independent validator nodes. As long as a threshold of honest nodes participate, the transaction can be validated without revealing any private transaction details. This provides privacy and security without sacrificing decentralization.
Sharding is a technique for distributing the transaction load across multiple independent "shards" or partitions of the network. In Gemini, the network is split into 64 shards, each processing transactions independently in parallel. This allows Gemini to scale transaction throughput linearly as more shards are added. With 64 shards currently, Gemini can process over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS).
Together, MPC and sharding allow Gemini to achieve unprecedented scalability and privacy without compromising on security or decentralization. No other blockchain comes close to matching Gemini's throughput and performance characteristics. 
##### Some key technical details of how Gemini achieves this include:
- MPC is implemented using a technique called SPDZ (Secure Multi-Party Computation) which splits transactions into cryptographic shares that are distributed across nodes. As long as a threshold of nodes are honest, transactions can be validated without revealing private details.
- The network is split into 64 shards with each shard processing transactions independently in parallel. This allows throughput to scale linearly with the number of shards. 
- Each shard has its own block proposers that are selected via a verifiable random function (VRF). This ensures proposer selection is random, permissionless and unpredictable.
- Shards communicate with each other via cross-links that allow atomic commits of transactions across shards, ensuring consistency and coherency across the network.
- A BFT consensus protocol called HotStuff is used within each shard to reach agreement on block proposals. This provides high throughput, security and decentralization. 
- MPC circuits are pre-compiled and stored on-chain, allowing for fast validation times on the order of milliseconds per transaction. 
- Advanced techniques like recursive composition of MPC circuits allow Gemini to support complex multi-party smart contracts and decentralized applications.
- Over 10,000 TPS can currently be supported with potential to scale linearly as more shards are added. This surpasses centralized systems and is several orders of magnitude more than layer 1 blockchains.
- Gemini provides a high level of privacy as no single party can learn transaction details due to MPC. It also supports advanced features like confidential transactions.
- The network is permissionless and open for anyone to participate as a validator. No special hardware or resources are required beyond a standard server.
In summary, Gemini represents a major breakthrough in blockchain scalability and performance through its novel use of MPC and sharding. It achieves throughputs and scalability that surpass centralized systems while maintaining decentralization, security and privacy. As one of the first live implementations of MPC for blockchains, Gemini paves the way for widespread adoption of decentralized technologies through its ability to process thousands of transactions per second. With continued development, Gemini has the potential to scale to support millions or even billions of users worldwide.

## Capabilities:

- Learning new skills: Gemini Ultra can learn new skills and concepts from users, either in text or voice, such as languages, math, science, art, and more.

Gemini achieves unprecedented scalability for a blockchain through its use of sharding and secure multi-party computation techniques. The network is divided into 64 independent shards, each processing transactions in parallel to significantly increase overall transaction throughput. By distributing load across multiple shards, Gemini can scale its performance linearly simply by adding more shards to the network. This approach allows Gemini to currently process over 10,000 transactions per second, far surpassing other blockchain platforms. 
In addition to high scalability, Gemini also provides strong privacy protections for users. Through the use of secure multi-party computation (MPC), transactions can be validated on the blockchain without any single party learning the contents or values of a transaction. MPC allows the transaction logic and validation to be run in a distributed and cryptographically secure manner across multiple independent nodes. This preserves users' privacy while maintaining decentralization. 
The Gemini network is also fully permissionless, meaning anyone can participate as a validator without the need for special resources or access. Validators use a verifiable random function to get randomly and unpredictably selected to propose new blocks, preventing centralization. Within each shard, the efficient HotStuff BFT consensus protocol allows validators to quickly agree on the transaction order. Cross-links then ensure atomic commits of transactions occur consistently across all shards.
This unique architecture powered by MPC and sharding enables Gemini to support complex smart contracts and decentralized applications through its Turing-complete scripting language. Pre-compiled MPC circuits allow transactions to be validated rapidly in milliseconds. The open standard design of Gemini allows others to build upon its capabilities and core protocol. Overall, Gemini provides a scalable, private and smart contract-enabled blockchain through novel technical innovations.


## Safety measures:

Gemini Ultra is designed to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy, following Google’s AI principles and practices3. Some of the safety measures that Gemini Ultra employs are:
- Data privacy and security: Gemini Ultra uses encryption, anonymization, and other techniques to protect the data and information of users and partners from unauthorized access or misuse.
- Fairness and inclusivity: Gemini Ultra strives to avoid bias and discrimination in its outputs and behaviors, and to respect the diversity and values of users and communities.
- Accountability and transparency: Gemini Ultra provides explanations and justifications for its outputs and behaviors, and allows users and partners to provide feedback and control over its actions.
- Ethical and social responsibility: Gemini Ultra adheres to the ethical and social norms and standards of the domains and contexts that it operates in, and avoids causing harm or offense to users and others.

Gemini employs a technique called multi-party computation (MPC) that forms the backbone of its security model. With MPC, cryptographic shares of each transaction are distributed across independent validator nodes. As long as over a threshold of nodes remain honest, the network remains secure even if some nodes misbehave or encounter issues. This approach eliminates any single point of failure and prevents the compromise of an entire shard from impacting others. Each of Gemini's 64 shards also operates independently, utilizing the efficient HotStuff BFT consensus protocol to order transactions within the shard.
In addition to the technical protections, Gemini also uses economic incentives to encourage secure and honest behavior from nodes. As a proof-of-stake system, validators stake tokens that can be slashed for misbehavior like double-signing transactions or violating protocol rules. This deters attacks and faults that could compromise the network. Validator selection is also randomized using a verifiable random function, making it unpredictable which nodes will propose new blocks. This prevents the targeting of key nodes.
Gemini also employs rigorous automated testing and review of all code changes prior to deployment. Its developers carefully analyze any potential vulnerabilities and work to address them proactively. Once live, the network is constantly monitored by Google to detect anomalies or issues. Patches can then be quickly rolled out across validator nodes if needed. Additional controls restrict which nodes can access sensitive data or perform privileged operations like governance functions. Overall, Gemini's layered security model leverages decentralization, economic incentives and operational best practices to maximize safety for users.
